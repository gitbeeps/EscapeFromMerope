# EscapeFromMerope
This is "Escape from Merope," a text based adventure game inspired by Frontier Development's "Elite: Dangerous." I created this while following the Udemy course "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D."

In each scene you'll be offered two options, use the number keys 1 and 2 to make your selection. There are many ways to lose but only a few ways to win. It's relatively short, so play multiple times to see where the game takes you. Good luck, CMDR!
